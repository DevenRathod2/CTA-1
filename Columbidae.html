                    Doves and pigeons are family members of Columbidae. There are about 310 species of doves 
                    available. These are considered as symbols of love. They weigh about 900 g-2.1 kg. The 
                    length of their body ranges for adult male 55 cm, 70 cm for western crowned pigeon, and 
                    13-15 cm for the dwarf. The clutch size is about only 1. Its prey includes seed or fruit. 
                    They live mostly in tropical nature and woodlands and are adjustable to any environment. 
                    Both parents do incubation. Male birds make woo-hoo sounds to indicate they are single.
