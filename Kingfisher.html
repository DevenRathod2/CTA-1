                 trees, and water kingfishers. There are about 90 species in kingfishers.  Kingfisher has a large
                 head, sharp, long, and pointed bills with short legs and stubby tails. Most of the species have
                 plumage with differences in their sexes. These are mostly found in forests in tropical regions.
                 They generally feed on fish and a wide range of prey. They love to live near rivers to eat fish.
                 Their nest will be in cavities; tunnels dug into artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of kingfishers
